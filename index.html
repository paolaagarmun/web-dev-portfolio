    <p>Pintok</p>
    <p>For the past two years TikTok has revolutionazed the social media game. We've learned recepies, dances,
        travel hacks, book recommendations, etc. However, where are all of these videos? TikTok has yet to provide
        a way to organize all of its great content. That is what Pintok is all about... create your own categories to 
        organize your favorite videos and see what other users have created! Have fun!
